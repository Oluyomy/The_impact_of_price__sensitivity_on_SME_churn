# The_impact_of_price__sensitivity_on_SME_churn
This is a BCG project on building a churn model to undestand whether price sensitivity is a large driver of churn potential in SMEs
# Project/Goals
The goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets ,build a churn model to undestand whether price sensitivity is a large driver of churn potential in SMEs and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions making.
Questions asked:
- Are there any missing values in the dataset?
- How are the predictor variables related to the outcome variable?
- What is the correlation between the predictor variables?
- What is the distribution of each predictor variable?
- Are there any outliers in the predictor variables?
- How are the predictor variables related to each other?
- Is there any interaction effect between the predictor variables?

# Process
Step 1: Obtaining data- download the csv files
This dataset is originally from the Forage , it is a  virtual -Experience- Program site
[Forage Dataset](https://www.theforage.com/modules/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK/uL2qbuBpZJxqfXdEG)

Step 2: Loading and understanding the dataset.
- 
- Having a general understanding and information about the relationship between various features that contribute to the target variable.

Step 3: EDA.exploratory data analysis, 
- look into the data types, data statistics, specific parameters, and variable distributions. 
- Create a displot, histplot, scatterplot and pairplot to look at the distributions of different predictor variables and their correlation.
- Learn the trend and detect outlier or possible factor that can affect the statistical model.
- Create heatmap to take a closer look at the corellation.

Step 4: preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Detect and handle outliers.
- Structure the data for efficient analysis.
- Split the into training and testing for appropriate training .
- Scale the data 

Step 5: Building a  Logistic regression model.


step 6: Evaluation metrics: Appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, confusion matrix and Classification Report were included to futher evaluate our models.

step 7: Hypertuning and Cross-validation were performed to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
